The uniforms addressed in this sub-addon are the "sleeves rolled up" version of their "sleeves rolled down" counterpart.
The problem is, that the rolled up version are both, 1 lb lighter, and can carry 1 lb less. 

If we would ignore this, the player would run into situations where they would lose items by simply rolling up their sleeves.
To counter this, I increased the maxLoad of those items by 1 lb to be aligned with their counterpart.
